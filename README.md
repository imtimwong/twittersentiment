# twittersentiment
<h1>Personal project to analyse tweets</h1>

<h2>Why this project?</h2>
<p>The objective is to learn to work with semi-structured data and Python. To stream live data and pump it into Postgresql for sentiment analysis. (Tech used: Python, Postgresql, Docker Container, tweepy library)

Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/imtimwong/twittersentiment/blob/feature1/teststream.py">teststream.py</a>.

Milestones: 
1. Apply for twitter developer account and credentials. << Done &#10004;
2. Build basic twitter streamer with authentication and print tweets to screen using Tweepy << Done &#10004;
3. Seperate features into different classes to enhance reusability << Done &#10004;
4. Write tweets into text delimited text file (just another option to store data instead of db) << Done &#10004;
5. Establish database connection to Postgresql << WIP &#128736;
6. Design db tables to store tweets and load tweets into tables
7. More to come...


Current project status: Printing to screen and writing into a delimited text file.<br>
Next milestone: Pumping tweets into a db.

Ps: Stay tuned for more updates!

Have a lovely day! </p>
